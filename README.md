# Differential Gene Expression of Venetoclax-resistant cells

Differential gene expression analysis of Venetoclax-resistant mantle cell lymphoma cell line transcriptome.

This workflow does not include QC, trimming, or quantification steps, but fastQC, TrimGalore, and salmon were used for this respectively. 

The data analysed as part of this exercised comes from Zhao et al. 2019 (10.1016/j.ccell.2019.04.005); the raw data can be downloaded here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE116132.
